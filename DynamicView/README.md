# Smart Client Dynamic View

Each time an alarm is selected in the alarm list, a MIP message is sent
within the Smart Client, to notify all plug-ins about the new alarm
being selected. To see the dynamic view, you need to have a an alarm
list which sends messages.

This sample creates a new view in a floating window when a message is
received.

The sample listens on a message issued by the Event.Platform plugin when
the user selects an alarm.

~~~cs
             _cameraListReceiver = EnvironmentManager.Instance.RegisterReceiver(
                            new MessageReceiver(CameraListReceiver),
                            new MessageIdFilter("AlarmList.ObjectSelected.Information"));
~~~

When the Alarm list is displayed within the **Alarm Overview** work
space, the id also contains the ObjectId of the work space, e.g. the
Guid. To receive these alarm selections as well, the following code can
be used:

~~~cs
             _cameraListReceiver = EnvironmentManager.Instance.RegisterReceiver(
                            new  MessageReceiver(CameraListReceiver),
                            new  MessageIdFilter("AlarmList.ObjectSelected.Information*"));
~~~

As the \'\*\' at the end of the message will match any characters.
