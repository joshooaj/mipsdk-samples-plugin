# Transact Connector

This plug-in demonstrates how to feed transaction data into the system.

The sample adds a new type of connector, \"Sample Connector\", to the
list of connectors available when configuring a Transact source.

As opposed to real connector plug-in it does not get data from any
external sources, but instead auto-generates transaction data.
