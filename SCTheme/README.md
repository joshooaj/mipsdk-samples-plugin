# Smart Client Theme

The SCTheme sample illustrates how the appearance of user controls change when
a theme is applied.

The sample also demonstrates how a MIP plug-in can change the selected
theme.

WPF Element 2 will not be adjusted by any theme changes, while the appearance of
the rest of the sample will change depending on the theme. The sample will be
themed during initialization and when the user toggles the theme selection button
on the top, or via the theme select dropdown in this sample.

- How to access the currently selected theme
