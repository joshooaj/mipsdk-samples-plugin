A sample to show how currently selected camera IDs can be fetched after
a camera view item has been selected.

The sample will use the currently selected camera id by inserting it in
a floating window with two camera view items, and alternate the
placement of a selected camera in the top and the bottom view item.

The code for the floating window can be modified to be used for other
usages, e.g. make your own matrix window based on events coming from
another system.
